# MNIST Canvas


### **Research Background**


The MNIST Canvas dataset is an extension of the well-known MNIST dataset that was introduced in 2017 by the TensorFlow team at Google.
Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in the field of machine learning and computer vision and has been extensively studied for many years.
The original MNIST dataset, with its large collection of grayscale images of handwritten digits, has become a benchmark for evaluating the performance of machine learning models in this task.

However, with advancements in deep learning, there has been a renewed interest in developing more accurate models for handwritten digit recognition.
To address this, the MNIST Canvas dataset was created to expand the MNIST dataset and provide a more realistic and diverse set of handwritten digits for machine learning models to train on.
The MNIST Canvas dataset contains over 200,000 handwritten digit images, which are split into a training set of 160,000 images and a test set of 40,000 images.
The images are in grayscale, and the pixel values are represented as integers between 0 and 255.

The MNIST Canvas dataset was developed to provide a more user-friendly and interactive environment for researchers to study and evaluate the performance of machine learning models.
The dataset allows users to draw a digit on a canvas and see the prediction made by the model in real-time. This can be a valuable tool for researchers to experiment with different models,
try out new ideas, and quickly evaluate their results. The development of the MNIST Canvas has also seen advancements in the models used for prediction,
with deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) being the most used. Techniques such as transfer learning and fine-tuning have also been incorporated to improve the performance of these models.


Despite its usefulness, the MNIST Canvas dataset has potential limitations. The quality of the drawn digits can vary widely depending on the skill and style of the user,
which can make it more difficult for machine learning models to accurately classify the digits. Additionally, the dataset only includes digits and does not include other types of handwritten characters or symbols,
limiting its usefulness in applications where recognition of a wider range of characters is required.


To address these limitations, researchers could explore ways to enhance the quality of the drawn digits, such as using machine learning-based smoothing or noise reduction techniques.
Expanding the dataset to include other types of handwritten characters and symbols could also increase its usefulness in a wider range of applications.
Furthermore, researchers could investigate the use of newer deep learning models or advanced techniques for image augmentation and regularization,
which could potentially improve the performance of machine learning models on the MNIST Canvas dataset.


The MNIST Canvas dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of machine learning and computer vision. Although there are potential limitations to the dataset,
the continued progress of the MNIST Canvas is expected to lead to further advances in the field of handwritten digit recognition.


### **Research Objective**


A potential research objective of comparing models for MNIST Canvas is to evaluate and compare the performance of different machine learning models for handwritten digit recognition on the MNIST Canvas dataset.
This objective could involve comparing the performance of various models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other deep learning models,
using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The goal would be to determine which model is best suited for accurately recognizing and classifying handwritten digits in a real-world context,
considering the variability and diversity of the MNIST Canvas dataset.


This research objective can be further broken down into specific goals, such as exploring the effectiveness of different deep learning models,
investigating the impact of image augmentation and regularization techniques, and comparing the performance of models with and without transfer learning.
The goal of this research is to identify the most accurate and efficient machine learning models for handwritten digit recognition on the MNIST Canvas dataset.
